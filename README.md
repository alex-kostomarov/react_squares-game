2. If the player manages to click on the highlighted cell (yellow) within N milliseconds, then one point is added to the player.
3. If the player does not have time to click on the cell (yellow) during this time, the point is awarded to the computer.
4. If the player or the computer scores 10 points, then the game is terminated and the player will see a message about the results of the game in a pop-up modal window.
